# The "Open Wine Database" app

In this step, we will create a React application to browse wine regions and give some details about wines.

Take a look at the wireframe of the app:

* The first column contains the wine regions. A click on a region changes the content of the second column.
* The second column is the list of the wines of the selected region. A click on a wine changes the content of the third column.
* The third column contains all the details of the selected wine :
  * name
  * robe (red, white, ros√©...)
  * appellation
  * grapes
  * picture

## Let's go!

Before you start coding, there are few questions to ask:

* Which are the components of the app and what is the hierarchy between components?
* What is the data managed by each component? Should I manage the data with `props` or with `state`?
* Ho do my components communicate? Which events should I manage?
* Once I'm ready, how to start coding the app?

## Component hierarchy

The first thing to do is to ***"Think React"*** :-)

From the wireframe we can identify sevral components:

* `Regions`: the component that manages the list of wine regions (left column)
* `WineList`: the component that manages the list of the wines of the selected region (middle column)
* `Wine`: the component that manages the details of the selected wine (right column)
* `WineApp`: this is a sort of parent component, a container that assemble the other components.

## Props and state

The data managed by the wine application are:

* the list of wine regions
* the selected region
* the list of the wines of the selected region
* the selected wine (and its details)

So, should we use `props` or `state` to store these data in our components?
The solution is quite easy!
Because the component `props` are immutable and the component `state` is mutable, we usually define two types of components in a React app:

* **Dumb components**: they are also called *Presentational components* and are concerned with *how things look*. They use `props` only.
* **Smart components**: they are also called *Container components* and are concerned with *how things work*. They use `state`.

Feel free to read this [great post about Smart and Dumb components](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0#.a0czhe4g8).

In our React application, `Regions`, `WineList` and `Wine` are Dumb Components (presentational stuff only),they only use their `props`. `WineApp` is a Dumb Component, aka the container that will make the Dumb Components work together. It uses its `state`.
